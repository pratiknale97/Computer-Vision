# Computer-Vision

-> PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The most fascinating part of Deep Learning, the "Computer Vision". Evolution of the technology has enabled the study of images and it immediately caught the limelight with its versatile application spanning from product selection in retail to the identification of patterns in forensics. These techniques have delivered wounders in achieving breakthroughs for a few of the most daunting social problems & business needs. As fancy as its output looks, it's also one of the toughest approaches the AIML community has unvailed. Computer vision with its wide application in Health care has been listed on the top of  "Emerging trends of AIML" continuously for the past few years.
This project will unveil how objects are identified and recognised. Starting from dealing with images, concepts of CNN, popular neural nets & their respective performances, we address the importance of transfer learning and how to achieve transfer learning. Going beyond applying CNNs for regular classification problems, you shall learn how to achieve semantic segmentation and define boundary boxes for object detection. You shall go through architectures like R-CNN, YOLO and SSD for the same. Finally a brief discussion on metric learning, specifically Siamese Network architecture to implement metric learning and then close the course with Joint layers.
